Question 1

Write a program which declare an array named intArray and initialize the array with integer 
values 11,0,10,2,2. Use a for loop to find the highest value stored in the array and display 
the result using an alert box (Note: the program should still work if more random integers are 
added to the array).

Question 2
Write a JavaScript program that prompts user to enter the value of his/her name 
and year of birth, computes the age and displays the output

Question 3
Create a Circle object that simulates a Circle. You should:

1. Write a constructor method that allows you to initialize the radius of a Circle.

2. Write the method getArea() which returns the circle's area. You should use the constant PI from the Math class.

3. Create an instance of Circle named circle1 with radius of 2.

4. Display the radius and area of circle1 using the alert dialog box.

5. Modify the size of circle1 to radius 3.

6. Display the new radius and area of circle1 using the alert dialog box.

Question 4
Create a Movie class in JavaScript that has the following properties: title, director, genre, 
rating and year. Then create three Movie objects and assign values to their properties. 

Finally, calculate the average ratings for the three movies and display the results to the console.

Hint: Make use of array to store the movie objects, to calculate the average ratings, you can 
loop through the array and calculate the average using the formula sum of 
all ratings / number of movies.

Question 5
You are to create a program to generate an array of random numbers and then find the 
highest number in the array. To do this, you are required to write two 
functions: getRandomNumber(size) and findMax(arr).

getRandomNumber(size) should take in a parameter size which determines the length of the array 
to be generated. The function should generate an array of random numbers (1 to 100, inclusive) 
using the Math.random() function, and should return this array.

findMax(arr) should take in an array as a parameter, and should return the highest number in 
the array. You are not allowed to use any predefine JavaScript function, and will need to 
iterate through the array using a loop, comparing each element to determine the highest number 
and return it.

Once you have written these two functions, use them to find the highest number in an array of 
15 random numbers. To do this, you can call the getRandomNumber(size) function with a value 
for size, and then pass the resulting array to the findMax(arr) function. Finally, you are 
to display the array of numbers and the highest number found to the console using console.log().
