    <title>Question 4</title>

    <!-- Create a Movie class in JavaScript that has the following properties: title, director, genre, 
    rating and year. Then create three Movie objects and assign values to their properties. 

    Finally, calculate the average ratings for the three movies and display the results to the console.

    Hint: Make use of array to store the movie objects, to calculate the average ratings, you can 
    loop through the array and calculate the average using the formula sum of 
    all ratings / number of movies.

    Can you think of any useful method to be included for the Movie class? -->
